*How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link? *

The internet simply moves data from one place to another, and then back to you in a response so that we can do many
different things on the internet, including chatting, accessing our bank, and sharing information. The internet is essentially a connection of 
millions and millions of computers interacting and sharing.


When you click on a link, your browser and operating system figure out where you've clicked aka a request is sent. Your browser takes that URL, breaks out the name of the web site, and 
then uses the DNS to get an IP address for the site. Your browser then opens a connection to the web site over IP.  It asks to "speak" to the HTTP server (or, for secure connections, HTTPS) which 
then provides the next web page in HTML that your browser renders.
